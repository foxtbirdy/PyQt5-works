# About Program
Hi Hi there,
Hope you guys are fine and good.
The PyGUI Widget Design #1 is just a simple GUI python file<i>(that is a lie)</i>. Really excited to see your remake of this program. 

### Guide to run program
Complete the <b>requirements</b> above </br>Download these 2 files.![pic](https://github.com/Code-Blender-7/Designing_Mayhems/blob/main/PyGUI%20Widget%20Design%20%231/Images%20for%20Readme.md/HHHEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAA..png?raw=true)

### How does it work?
The program uses the pyqt5 library for the GUI. </br>Since many people complain annoying issus of file managements to me (<i>which is a pain</i>), the program uses [resource.py](https://github.com/Code-Blender-7/Designing_Mayhems/blob/main/PyGUI%20Widget%20Design%20%231/Main%20files/resources.py) which is a python file storing a large pile of .xml data.</br>
You might be thinking that <i>What are these codes? What do they mean?</i>. The codes are .xml file data that are changed from a .svg format to a .py using pyrcc5.</br> In other words, The [resource.py](https://github.com/Code-Blender-7/Designing_Mayhems/blob/main/PyGUI%20Widget%20Design%20%231/Main%20files/resources.py) is actually a list of included .svg icon files stored in a python file. Without this file, the [main.py](https://github.com/Code-Blender-7/Designing_Mayhems/blob/main/PyGUI%20Widget%20Design%20%231/Main%20files/main.py) cannot run. 

### Requirements
